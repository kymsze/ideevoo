description: "This is a pendant necklace I've made from a section of a Tanqueray No.
  Ten bottle. I melted and tumbled the cut glass to a soft sea glass finish. I then
  formed copper fittings at the ends. The necklace is strung on a shiny copper chain
  with a copper lobster clasp. The pendant measures about 3 inches across. The chain
  is 16 inches long, but please let me know if you'd like yours longer or shorter.
