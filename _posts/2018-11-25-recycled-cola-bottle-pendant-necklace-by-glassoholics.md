description: |-
  This is a pendant necklace I've made from part of a cut, melted, annealed, and tumbled cola bottle. It has a frosted sea-glass finish and the original soft green cola bottle colour. It is strung on a shiny copper chain with copper lobster clasps. The pendant is roughly 2 inches long. The chain is 18 inches long.
