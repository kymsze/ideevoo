description: This is a pendant necklace I've made from a Cupcake Sauvignon Blanc wine
  bottle. I've melted, cut, and frosted the glass to a sea glass finish, then framed
  it in copper. The glass has the soft, subtle aqua shade of the original bottle.
  It is strung on a shiny copper chain. This pendant measures about 3/4 by 1-1/4 inches.
  The chain is 18 inches long.
