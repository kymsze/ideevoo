description: 'This gorgeous large quilted makeup bag is part of a limited edition
  of one hundred. Handprinted in deep charcoal on stone brown cotton in my own bee
  design and lined in black cotton. By using a cotton lining these makeup bags are
  machine washable on a cool/ gentle. When the inside gets messy you can just throw
  it in the machine instead of throwing it out. No more scrubbing and cracked linings!
  The natural cotton wadding not only gives that fabulous soft feel but also protects
  your makeup. Made with a box shape base this large makeup bag stands up on its own.
  Useful for organising and storing your daily cosmetics. 10% of all proceeds from
  my Bee collection are donated to The BumbleBee Conservation Trust. I use eco friendly
  water based inks that have been heat set for durability. I use only the best high
  quality cotton fabric. After washing reshape whilst damp and can be ironed flat.
  Measurements: 28 x 20 x 9 cm / 11 x 8 x 4 inches'
