description: his gorgeous large quilted makeup bag is part of a limited edition of
  one hundred. Handprinted in glorious deep turquoise on pale grey cotton in my own
  hand drawn monstera leaf design and lined in black cotton. By using a cotton lining
  these makeup bags are machine washable on a cool/ gentle. When the inside gets messy
  you can just throw it in the machine instead of throwing it out. No more scrubbing
  and cracked linings! Quilted in a crosshatch design using a deep grey thread. The
  outer not only gives that fabulous soft feel but also protects your makeup. Made
  with a box shape base this large makeup bag stands up on its own. Useful for organising
  and storing your daily cosmetics. I use eco friendly water based inks that have
  been heat set for durability. I use only the best high quality cotton fabric. After
  washing reshape whilst damp and can be ironed flat.
